After checking out the repository, you'll need to do two things to get started:

1. Run `bower install` in the root directory
2. Compile the SASS styles into `style/screen.min.css` by running the SASS compiler on `style/sass/screen.scss`

This will install all necessary dependencies and compile the SASS into CSS.

Don't have Bower?

[Check out the Bower homepage](http://bower.io/)

Don't have a SASS compiler?

I use [Koala](http://koala-app.com/), and I really like it.
